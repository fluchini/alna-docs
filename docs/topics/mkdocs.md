## Features

### Great themes available

There's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: mkdocs and readthedocs, select one of the third-party themes (on the MkDocs Themes wiki page as well as the MkDocs Catalog), or build your own.

### Easy to customize

Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing your theme and/or installing some plugins. Modify Markdown's behavior with Markdown extensions. Many configuration options are available.

### Preview your site as you work

The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.

### Host anywhere

MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or anywhere else you choose.
