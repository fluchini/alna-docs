## Docs with Markdown

To create all documentation we are going to use a notation called **Markdown**. Markdown is a popular and easy way to write documents, without a need to install anything or having a big training to use it. In a few words a would say it is a simple technic, not a huge technology :slight_smile:   

You can learn more about Markdown in: [Markdown Topic](topics/markdown.md)

## Docs using MkDocs

To help us to publish the Markdown as a website\wiki documentation, now we are going to use a tool called **MkDocs**. It is a free and open source tool that allow us to manage and publish our Markdown documentation.

You can learn more about MkDocs in: [MkDocs Topic](topics/mkdocs.md)
